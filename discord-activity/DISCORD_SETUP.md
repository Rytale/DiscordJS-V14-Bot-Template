3. Join a voice channel
4. Run `/watch url:https://example.com/video.mp4 title:Test Movie`
5. Click the launch button

### Method 2: Local Testing with Discord Proxy

**Prerequisites**:
- Install [Discord Local Development](https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/building-an-activity#step-3-installing-a-dev-tunnel)
- Node.js 18+

**Steps**:

1. Install cloudflared:
   ```bash
   # Windows (via Chocolatey)
   choco install cloudflared
   
   # macOS (via Homebrew)
   brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared
   
   # Linux
   wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64
   ```

2. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   cd discord-activity
   npm run dev
   ```

3. In a new terminal, start cloudflared tunnel:
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. Copy the generated URL (e.g., `https://xyz.trycloudflare.com`)

5. Add URL mapping in Discord Developer Portal:
   - Environment: Development
   - URL Prefix: Your cloudflared URL

6. Test using Discord desktop client in developer mode

### Method 3: Direct URL Testing

For quick testing without bot integration:

1. Get your deployed activity URL
2. Add query parameters manually:
   ```
   https://your-activity.vercel.app/?streamUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fvideo.mp4&title=Test%20Movie
   ```
3. Open in Discord activity test mode
